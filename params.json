{"name":"Predicting NIH Research Funding for Emerging Health Issues","tagline":"Harvard CS109 Final Project by Jonathan Campbell, Jordan Canedy and Sobha Sankaran","body":"# Project Overview\r\n---\r\n### Motivation\r\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH), the nation’s medical research agency has paved the way for important discoveries that have improved health and saved lives for centuries.   Approximately 83% of NIH’s $30.3 billion FY 2015 budget goes to more than 300,000 research personnel at over 3,000 universities, medical schools, and other research institutions in every state and throughout the world to support research that turns discovery into health.  One of the challenges faced by NIH is ensuring adequate funding for research associated with emerging health issues.  As the specific work associated with emerging issues is inherently difficult to describe in detail at the time of application, applicants typically describe the process by which they plan to identify, prioritize and address newly arising concerns and respond to them.  This element of uncertainty detracts from NIH’s research priorities.  This problem calls for a more scientific approach to emerging health issues identification and research funding.  We propose a new data science program that identifies emerging health issues and predicts grant funding for related research at some future point in time.  \r\n\r\n### Objectives\r\nOur primary objective is to answer the following questions:\r\n*\tWhat research topics are receiving increased attention? \r\n*\tWhat do grant funding patterns look like and how that translates to emerging health issues?\r\n*\tCan we integrate these explanatory variables and the funding patterns into a predictive algorithm that would predict level of funding for emerging health issues research?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Approach\r\nWe began our study by scraping relevant datasets from the NIH website. We then performed a series of exploratory analyses to understand how different variables were associated with one another. These explorations revealed important patterns about grant funding.  We also incorporated mapping and clustering operations into our exploratory phase to identify top categories indicative of emerging health issues.  The information collected during the exploratory phase led to the creation of predictive algorithms using multiple regression.\r\n\r\n### Exploratory Data Analysis\r\n---\r\nAs a general introduction to the NIH grant system it is useful look at the overall budget by fiscal year since 2008. The NIH grant funding budget typically ranges in the order of 20 to 30 billion dollars for a given fiscal year.  \r\n![Grant Budget](./Images/Budget.PNG)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the funding amount transformed to a log scale follow a normal distribution.\r\n![Funding Distribution](./Images/LogFunding.PNG)\r\n\r\nVisualizing the top research categories that were funded each year revealed very little change year over year for the top topics.  This was indicative of the pattern of top topics to expect for next year.  The top 10 NIH research grant categories were:\r\n![The Top 10](./Images/Top10.PNG)\r\n\r\nLast but not least, our exploratory analyses also revealed the linear relationship between the number of categories and funding.\r\n![Categories Count](./Images/NIHCatCount.PNG)\r\n\r\nThis visualization was an attempt to see if the top NIH_SPENDING_CATEGORIES changed year over year. As evidenced by this graph, there was very little change between the years. Although, the order changed slightly, the same 6 categories were in the top for each year.\r\nThis lead us down the path that the top terms year over year would be very good predictors for the next years terms. In other words, we should expect to see the a similar pattern for future years.\r\nThe log transformed funding amount follows a normal distribution over the number of approved grant applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prediction\r\n---\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
