{"name":"Predicting NIH Research Funding for Emerging Health Issues","tagline":"Harvard CS109 Final Project by Jonathan Campbell, Jordan Canedy and Sobha Sankaran","body":"# Project Overview\r\n---\r\n### Motivation\r\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH), the nation’s medical research agency has paved the way for important discoveries that have improved health and saved lives for centuries.   Approximately 83% of NIH’s $30.3 billion FY 2015 budget goes to more than 300,000 research personnel at over 3,000 universities, medical schools, and other research institutions in every state and throughout the world to support research that turns discovery into health.  One of the challenges faced by NIH is ensuring adequate funding for research associated with emerging health issues.  As the specific work associated with emerging issues is inherently difficult to describe in detail at the time of application, applicants typically describe the process by which they plan to identify, prioritize and address newly arising concerns and respond to them.  This element of uncertainty detracts from NIH’s research priorities.  This problem calls for a more scientific approach to emerging health issues identification and research funding.  We propose a new data science program that identifies emerging health issues and predicts grant funding for related research at some future point in time.  \r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nOur primary objective is to answer the following questions:\r\n*\tWhat research topics are receiving increased attention? \r\n*\tWhat do grant funding patterns look like and how that translates to emerging health issues?\r\n*\tCan we integrate these explanatory variables and the funding patterns into a predictive algorithm that would predict level of funding for emerging health issues research?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
